    <ul> <h2>Ingredients :</h2>
        <li>3 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
        <li>6 uncooked lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>1 cube chicken bouillon</li>
        <li>Â¼ cup hot water</li>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened</li>
        <li>2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>1 (26 ounce) jar spaghetti sauce</li>
    </ul>

    <ol><h2>Directions :</h2>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles for 8 to 10 minutes, or until al dente. Drain, rinse with cold water, and set aside.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, place the chicken in a saucepan with enough water to cover, and bring to a boil. Cook for 20 minutes, or until no longer pink and juices run clear. Remove from saucepan, and shred.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Dissolve the bouillon cube in hot water. In a large bowl, mix the chicken with the bouillon, cream cheese, and 1 cup mozzarella cheese.</li>
        <li>Spread 1/3 of spaghetti sauce in the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish. Cover with the chicken mixture, and top with 3 lasagna noodles; repeat. Top with remaining sauce, and sprinkle with remaining mozzarella cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake for 45 minutes in the preheated oven.</li>
